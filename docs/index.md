title: Code Quality Calculator — Student Textbook
---

# Welcome

This textbook teaches you how a small Python project can be engineered like a professional one. You will learn project structure, testing, formatting and linting, typing, security checks, CI, and VS Code workflows using this repository.

Use the chapters below in order. Each chapter links to real files in this repo and includes copy‑paste commands for macOS + zsh. Most chapters include “Try it” labs and “Check yourself” questions.

## Your first 10 minutes

1. Create a venv and install tools (see Setup)
2. Run the quality suite (tests, lint, mypy, security)
3. Try the CLI: `python -m src.main add 2 3` or `calc add 2 3` after install
4. Open VS Code → Run Task → "quality: all"
5. Skim the repo structure chapter for orientation
