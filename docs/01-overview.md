# 1) Project overview

This repository is a tiny calculator written in Python, designed to teach you professional software practices: clean structure, tests, formatting, linting, typing, security, CI, and editor automation. The code is simple so you can focus on the process.

You will learn to:
- Create and use a virtual environment (isolated dependencies)
- Format and lint code (Black, isort, Flake8, Pylint)
- Test with pytest and enforce 100% coverage for `src/`
- Add static typing with mypy
- Package and run a CLI (`calc`)
- Scan code and dependencies (Bandit, pip-audit, Dependabot)
- Use VS Code tasks and debug configurations effectively
- Run Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions)

By the end, you’ll be able to bootstrap and maintain a high‑quality Python repo.
