# 8) Continuous Integration (CI)

GitHub Actions runs quality checks on pushes and pull requests.

## Learning goals
- Read CI logs and understand each job’s purpose
- Reproduce CI steps locally
- Keep a branch green before merging

- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/quality.yml`
- Steps:
  - Set up Python 3.11
  - Install dev tools
  - Check format (Black/isort)
  - Lint (Flake8 on project files, Pylint)
  - Type check (mypy)
  - Security scan (Bandit)
  - Dependency audit (pip‑audit)

Keep CI green before merging.

## Try it

1. Push a branch and open a PR; watch the Actions tab and locate logs for flake8, pylint, mypy, and coverage.
2. Break a lint rule locally, commit, and confirm CI fails; then fix and re-push.

## Check yourself

- Where is the workflow file located? Which Python version does it pin?
- How would you add a step for `pre-commit run --all-files`?

## Background
CI started as nightly builds; modern pipelines validate every commit to keep main releasable.

## Across languages
Same idea with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI—YAML steps that install dependencies and run quality gates.

## Career connection
Green pipelines and thoughtful checks are the backbone of team velocity—platform and product engineers both contribute.
